# Kopoze Coding Style Guidelines

These coding style guidelines are intended to ensure consistency and readability in Kopoze codebase. Following these guidelines will make it easier for contributors to work on the project and for maintainers to review and merge pull requests.

## Formatting

- Use the official Go formatting tool `gofmt` to format your code. Run `gofmt -s` to apply simplifications.

    ```sh
    gofmt -s -w .
    ```

- Use spaces (not tabs) for indentation. Indentation should be 4 spaces.

## Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and packages.
- Favor camelCase for variable and function names.
- Use PascalCase for exported (public) names.
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are well-known and widely accepted (e.g., URL, HTTP).

Example:

```go

// Good
func CalculateTotalPrice(itemPrice float64, quantity int) float64 {
    // ...
}

// Bad
func calcTotP(itemP float64, qty int) float64 {
    // ...
}
```

## Comments

- Write clear and concise comments to explain the purpose and functionality of your code.
- Use comments to describe the public functions and methods, including their parameters and return values.
- Avoid redundant or obvious comments that merely restate the code.

Example:

```go
// CalculateTotalPrice calculates the total price based on the item price and quantity.
// It returns the total price as a float64.
func CalculateTotalPrice(itemPrice float64, quantity int) float64 {
    // ...
}
```

## Error Handling

- Always handle errors explicitly. Avoid suppressing errors or using _ to ignore them.
- Return errors whenever appropriate, and check for errors after function calls that may produce them.

Example:

```go
result, err := someFunction()
if err != nil {
    // Handle the error
}
```

## Imports

Organize imports in the following order:

1. Standard library packages
2. Third-party packages
3. Project-specific packages

Example:

```go
import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
    "github.com/yourusername/yourproject/pkg"
)
```

## Testing

- Write tests for your code using the Go testing framework (`testing` package).
- Organize test files in the same directory as the code they test, with a `_test.go` suffix.
- Use meaningful test function names beginning with `Test`.

## Documentation

- Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation for your project.
- Include a README.md file with project information, setup instructions, and usage examples.
- Document public functions, methods, and types using GoDoc-style comments.

## Version Control

- Follow the project's version control workflow and branching strategy.
- Write meaningful commit messages that summarize the purpose of the commit concisely.
- Use feature branches for developing new features or fixing specific issues.

## Contributing

Thank you for following these coding style guidelines and contributing to Kopoze! When submitting pull requests, please ensure your code adheres to these guidelines, and write tests to cover your changes whenever possible.

Happy coding!
